				<h2>About Me</h2>

			<img id="profpic" src="images/profile_pic.jpg">
			<p>I'm a full-stack software engineer with a lifelong passion for all things tech, including both a bachelorâ€™s in
			computer science and bootcamp education. I utilize my experience in team leadership and teaching, applying it to
			my work as a coder and as a productive team member. As a natural-born problem solver, I thrive on being
			challenged and working under pressure to solve complex problems.</p>
			<p>
				I've been designing websites and dabbling in HTML since I was in fourth grade, but my real journey into software engineering began in high school with Java, which remains one of my favorite languages to this day. I'm also very familiar with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, which is the backbone of my <a href="#work">CBO project</a> below. I also enjoy using JavaScript and Vue.js, and am familiar with CSS, Bootstrap, and XML.

				<h2>My Work</h2>
				<p>CBO is a web app that I built as my capstone for Actualize bootcamp. It is a directory of black owned bars and restraunts across Chicagoland, with the goal of helping people easily and quickly locate places in their area.</p>
				<p>CBO was inspired by the ongoing BLM movement in Chicago and nationwide. As a pandemic consumed the news cycle and protests erupted across the country, many of my friends were sharing lists of local, black-owned restaurants to support during these times. Restaurants still were not open for dine-in, but carry-out and delivery had become pretty popular, and my goal was to support local businesses that may be struggling due to COVID-19, especially those of our neighbors of color. I quickly realized that it was difficult to sort through dozens of lists of places across the city to find ones that were nearby, and decided that there should be a simpler, faster way to locate and organize the listings with an easy to use, pleasant interface. This seemed like a perfect challenge for me, so I got to work building CBO. And yes, my friends and I do now use it to find places to eat!</p>
				<p>The site is built using a Ruby on Rails backend, which utilizes PostgreSQL for my data. The frontend is built in Vue.js, and utilizes HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, as well as tapping into several very important APIs, including Yelp Fusion, Google Maps, and Mapbox. Click on the images for more info, and check out the site at <a href="http://www.cboeats.com/">www.cboeats.com</a>!</p>
